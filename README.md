# Kasparov
A project I created about a year ago... single page chess app in which you play Gary Kasparov.  As the game swings in favour of the player/AI sound clips are played to reflect the emotional state of AI Kasparov.  Right now needs a lot of work, the js coding is atrocious right now.  But I wanted to have it hosted.  Used to select moves using a C++ AI engine, but for the sake of practicality is now using garbochess.js library (http://forwardcoding.com/projects/chess/chess.html) for AI.

TO-DO 

Functionality To Add: 

- Recognize drawn positions
- Fix some bugs around promotion moves 
- Gather database of Kasparov games and have AI choose from a selection of Kasparov's recorded plays when possible
- Currently there are colour specific sound clips that play regardless of the colour of Kasparov's pieces.  Should fix.
- Have a way to control difficulty + have emotions effect Kasparov's play 

UI/Aesthetics: 

- Instead of the current layout create a note for note copy of Play Carlsen... except it's Kasparov and there are the humorous sound clips 
- Make this a mobile friendly page (maybe Twitter Bootstrap) 

Design: 
- Refactor this.  Don't know if I need to use a MV* framework necessarily, but the current state of code is sad.
